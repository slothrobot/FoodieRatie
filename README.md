# FoodieRatie

<p>Not sure about you, it is a project I definitely need -- to search, find and check others' reviews on a specific food product.</p>
<p>I always want to try new snacks, but don't want to waste my money... so I need to know others' opinions.</p>
<p>With FoodieRatie, easily find, rate and save a food product on your wishlist!</p>

Many thanks to OpenFoodFacts' amazing work ðŸ‘‰ https://world.openfoodfacts.org/

Just reviewing other's comments doesn't require login. Sorry for testing on you water, you must be a super good bottle of water.
